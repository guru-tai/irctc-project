            A <s>thread</s> is like a separate <b>program </b>, executing concurrently. 
            We can write <mark>Java programs</mark> that deal with many tasks at once 
            by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of 
            multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. 
            It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media,
            <u>Web applications</u>, etc.
